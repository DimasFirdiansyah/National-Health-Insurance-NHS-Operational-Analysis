In this section, the focus is placed on uncovering valuable insights from the dataset concerning missed, unattended, and records of appointments in the National Health Services (NHS). It is observed that appointments were scheduled within the timeframe of December 1, 2021, and June 30, 2022.
When examining the service settings in North West London for the first semester of 2022, it is discovered that the General Practice setting recorded the highest number of appointments, totaling 2104. This is followed by 'Other', 'Primary Care Network', 'Extended Access Provision', and 'Unmapped', which reported 1318, 1272, 1090, and 152 appointments, respectively.
The monthly appointment figures reveal interesting trends, with November 2021 witnessing the highest number of appointments, amounting to 30,405,070. October 2021, March 2022, September 2021, and May 2022 also showed significant appointment volumes, with approximately 30 million, 29.5 million, 28.5 million, and 27.4 million appointments, respectively.
Furthermore, an analysis of the total number of records per month indicates that November 2021 once again exhibited the highest number of appointments, with a total of 30,405,070 appointments. This comprehensive analysis establishes a foundation for drawing actionable insights to enhance appointment management in the NHS.



the result given from number of appointment relation with service setting, context type, and national category are :
- Service setting Appointments made for the general practice service setting dominate the majority, surpassing other categories such as primary care network, extended access provision, and others.
-	Context type the number of appointments under the 'Care Related Encounter' context type over time, with only minor fluctuations observed. This indicates a consistent and steady demand for care-related services throughout the analyzed timeframe.
- National category depicting the 'General Consultation Routine' consistently has the highest number of appointments, emphasizing the importance of ongoing patient care. 'Planned Clinics,' 'Clinical Triage,' and 'Home Visit' also demonstrate consistent appointment numbers, highlighting the significance of pre-planned activities and comprehensive healthcare services.The 'Unplanned Clinical Activity' category exhibits fluctuations, indicating varying urgent medical needs. Effective management and response to unforeseen healthcare requirements are crucial in this category.




In the analysis of the Twitter data, the focus was placed on identifying the top trending hashtags based on the frequency of their usage. By examining the count of hashtags in the dataset, valuable insights were gained into the most popular topics and themes within the given timeframe.
Based on the bar chart, it was observed that the hashtag "#healthcare" was found to have the most significant level of engagement and interest on this social media platform.
Furthermore, it was noted that several other hashtags with counts exceeding 20 also made their presence known within the dataset, suggesting their relevance to the ongoing discussions and topics.



### Should the NHS start looking at increasing staff levels?
considering the maximum daily appointment capacity of 1,200,000 set by the NHS can provide additional context for analyzing the utilisation trend. By comparing the utilisation trend with the maximum daily appointment capacity, we can assess whether the NHS is operating below, at, or above its maximum capacity.
From the provided utilisation data, we can observe that the utilisation values are consistently below the maximum daily appointment capacity of 1,200,000. This suggests that the NHS has not reached its maximum capacity during this observed period.

### How do the healthcare professional types differ over time?
As depicted in the count of appointments by healthcare professional type, General Practice exhibits a leading trend in appointment counts. Previous analysis indicates that General Practice type dominates over the majority of other practice staff. However, there are instances where the count of other practice staff surpassed General Practice, specifically in October 2020 and October 2021. These months may have been the busiest for other practice staff in terms of appointments.

### Are there significant changes in whether or not visits are attended?
The line chart illustrates the trends in attendance and DNA (Did Not Attend) status for appointments over a period of time. It is evident that the attendance rate remains relatively consistent throughout the months, ranging from around 7,500 to 8,000. There are slight variations, but no significant upward or downward trends can be observed. This indicates a consistent level of attendance for the appointments during the analyzed period.
In terms of the DNA status, there are fluctuations observed, but again, no clear increasing or decreasing trend is evident. The number of missed appointments ranges from approximately 5,000 to 5,800, with variations from month to month. This suggests that the rate of missed appointments remains relatively stable over the examined timeframe.

### Are there changes in terms of appointment type and the busiest months?
As illustrated in this chart, different modes of appointments, including face-to-face meetings, home visits, telephone calls, and video/online are analysed. The chart reveals that the most commonly preferred mode of appointment is face-to-face, with counts ranging from around 5700 and surpassing 6000 appointments. What's more, an upsurge in appointments is noticeable from August 2021, with the peak reached between October and November 2021. 
Interestingly, a noticeable decline in all modes of appointments can be seen between March and May 2020, which can be potentially attributed to the constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, three modes - face-to-face, home visits, and telephone consultations - demonstrate an upward trend in early 2021, indicating a recovery from the previously seen decline.
In contrast, the video/online mode exhibits a decrease in appointments starting from November 2022. This downward shift in the preference for online consultations is intriguing and warrants further investigation. The detailed analysis of appointment modes in this chart provides essential insights into patients' appointment preferences and the influence of external factors such as the pandemic.
Are there any trends in time between booking an appointment?
The line chart analysis reveals that appointment counts fluctuate over different periods. A relatively consistent pattern can be seen in the number of appointments throughout most time frames, albeit with minor monthly variations.
Most appointments tend to occur within the 42 to 45 counts range across diverse time periods. The "1 Day" interval consistently sees the highest volume of appointments, implying that many appointments are made and attended on the same day. In contrast, the "More than 28 Days" interval consistently records the lowest volume of appointments, indicating that fewer appointments are scheduled significantly ahead of time.
In summary, the line chart offers valuable insights into how appointments are distributed based on the duration between the booking and the actual appointment date.

### How do the spread of service settings compare?
The presented charts demonstrate that General Practice is the dominant service setting, surpassing other service settings such as Extended Access Provision, Other, and Primary Care Network in terms of appointment count. The Primary Care Network emerges as the second-highest service setting, with an average of approximately 590,000 appointments scheduled.
In contrast, the 'Other' category represents service settings facilitated by various providers, accounting for around 500,000 appointments. The charts indicate that the service setting with the lowest appointment count is Extended Access Provision.
